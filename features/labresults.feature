Feature: LabResults Functionality
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to interact with the LabResults module
  So that I can manage labresults tasks efficiently

  Scenario: Navigate to LabResults page
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to the LabResults page
    Then I should see the LabResults UI elements

  Scenario: Perform action on LabResults
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform action on LabResults with value "test-value"
    Then I should see the state as "Action completed"

  Scenario: Perform complex action on LabResults
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform complex action on LabResults with value "complex-test" and option "option2"
    Then I should see the state as "Complex action completed"
