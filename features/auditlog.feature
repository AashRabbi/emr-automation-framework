Feature: AuditLog Functionality
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to interact with the AuditLog module
  So that I can manage auditlog tasks efficiently

  Scenario: Navigate to AuditLog page
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to the AuditLog page
    Then I should see the AuditLog UI elements

  Scenario: Perform action on AuditLog
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform action on AuditLog with value "test-value"
    Then I should see the state as "Action completed"

  Scenario: Perform complex action on AuditLog
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform complex action on AuditLog with value "complex-test" and option "option2"
    Then I should see the state as "Complex action completed"
