Feature: RoleManagement Functionality
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to interact with the RoleManagement module
  So that I can manage rolemanagement tasks efficiently

  Scenario: Navigate to RoleManagement page
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to the RoleManagement page
    Then I should see the RoleManagement UI elements

  Scenario: Perform action on RoleManagement
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform action on RoleManagement with value "test-value"
    Then I should see the state as "Action completed"

  Scenario: Perform complex action on RoleManagement
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform complex action on RoleManagement with value "complex-test" and option "option2"
    Then I should see the state as "Complex action completed"
