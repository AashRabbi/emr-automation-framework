Feature: PatientDetails Functionality
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to interact with the PatientDetails module
  So that I can manage patientdetails tasks efficiently

  Scenario: Navigate to PatientDetails page
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I navigate to the PatientDetails page
    Then I should see the PatientDetails UI elements

  Scenario: Perform action on PatientDetails
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform action on PatientDetails with value "test-value"
    Then I should see the state as "Action completed"

  Scenario: Perform complex action on PatientDetails
    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    When I perform complex action on PatientDetails with value "complex-test" and option "option2"
    Then I should see the state as "Complex action completed"
